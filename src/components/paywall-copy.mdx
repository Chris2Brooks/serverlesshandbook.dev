## Learn everything you need to dive into modern backend. Understand _any_ backend

I spent a lot of time digging through the internet learning Serverless. Random StackOverflow answers, even comments, GitHub issues, sporadic blogs ... everyone assumes you've been a backend engineer for 20 years. It's a mess.

**Serverless Handbook** is the resource I wish I had.

If you're new to serverless, or completely new to backend, Serverless Handbook is for you. We'll cover everything from the basic definitions of queues and lambdas and databases, to optimizing for cost, building robust architectures for scale, and cost optimization.

**Unlock digital access immediately, get the paperback end of February**
