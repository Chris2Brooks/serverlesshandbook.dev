# Create a good serverless developer experience

![](../../images/chapter_headers/good-dx.svg)

What makes a good developer experience?

I asked twitter and it was all over the place. A theme emerged:

> Good developer experience is when tools make your job easier, get out of the way, and let you focus on *your* code

How do you setup a serverless project for good DX?

It comes down to 3 features:

1. Infrastructure-as-code
2. Fast deploys
3. Tooling for common tasks

## Infrastructure-as-code

https://twitter.com/muditameta/status/1195783892512444417

As mentioned in the [Getting Started](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/getting-started#setup-for-serverless-work) chapter, I like to use the open source [Serverless Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_Framework) with AWS. When using Netlify and Vercel you don't need Serverless because config-as-code is baked into their philosophies.

You write a configuration file, add it to version control, and that's your infrastructure. *Nothing* happens outside that configuration file.

This means that:

1. **Your deploys are repeatable**. Run deploy, get the same result every time. The same functions, the same queues, the same caching servers, everything.
2. **Same infrastructure in test as in prod** Subtle differences between test environments and production are a waste of time. Big part of why Docker got popular.
3. **Share infrastructure between the team**. Ever had to ask a team member what environment variable they used for a thing? I have. After 2 hours of digging into the problem and realizing it's a configuration issue. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4. **Infrastructure that always fits your feature branch** A common problem are new features with different infrastructure. Like adding a new queue or cloud function. Instead of setting it up every time you test, infra-as-code can do it for you.
5. **Spend time in the tools you like, not confusing web UI** We're engineers and we like building things. Not clicking around a web UI doing repetitive tasks that take 20 minutes.

## Fast deploys

https://twitter.com/CodingDive/status/1195776781921464321

The shorter your feedback cycle, the faster you can work. 

On the frontend we have local dev servers and hot reloading. You see the result almost as fast as you write the code.

On the backend things are trickier.

You make a change ... now what? If you have unit tests, they show you part of the picture. The specific scenarios you thought to test, the methods you're exercising, the particular inputs.

All great.

But unit tests can't tell you your *system* works. That's where bugs come from ‚Äì¬†systems complexity.

You can simulate the environment and run your tests. That works to an extent, but it's never perfect.

Your best bet is to make deploying to a staging, QA, or production environment fast enough to use for development. With serverless, that becomes possible.

You could even set it up so that pushing to GitHub deploys every branch. Netlify and Vercel call it pull request previews.

### How fast deploys work

Here's how the flow works:

0. Hit deploy
1. **Compile your code locally** on your fast developer machine. Since your code is small, it compiles in seconds.
2. **Compile your infrastructure** the serverless framework compiles your infrastructure into a config file for the target platform. With AWS that's [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).
3. **Upload your bundle** this is the slowest part.
4. **Infrastructure sets itself up** using your config the platform sets itself up. Servers appear, queues go up, etc. Takes a few seconds 
5. **You're ready to go**

<div id="lock" />

Slowest deploys I've seen on production-sized backends are in the 2 minute range. That's for a system with hundreds of lines of configuration.

On my side projects it's 30 seconds.

That's fantastic compared to a Heroku or Docker deploy that takes 20 minutes.

## Tooling for common tasks

I like to use my project's `package.json` as a collection of scripts for common tasks. `yarn` or `npm run` make them easy to run.

The most common is `yarn deploy`

```
# package.json

"scripts": {
	"build": "tsc build",
	"deploy": "npm run build && sls deploy"
}
```

With those 2 lines you can deploy from any branch without worry that you'll forget to build your project first. The `build` script runs a typescript build and `sls deploy` runs a serverless deploy.

This part gets trickier when you use multiple environments. We'll talk about that in [the chapter on prod, QA, and staging environments](/dev-qa-prod).

Other helpful tools I've set up for bigger projects include:

- `yarn psql` to connect to my remote database
- `reset-env` to reset a remote database for testing
- `test-X` to run different tests against the server environment
- `add-engineer` to add a new engineer-specific environment so everyone can test on their own

Any time you find yourself running the same sequence of commands, you should consider adding them as a script to `package.json`. Give others that same super power :)

# How this works in practice

![](giphy:hello_world)

In the next few minutes you're going to build your first serverless backend. A service that says Hello üëã

We're using open source technologies and deploying on AWS Lambda. You can learn about other providers in the [Serverless Flavors](/serverless-flavors) chapter.

You'll need a computer configured for JavaScript development: Have nodejs installed, a code editor, and a terminal.

### Setup for serverless work

When working with serverless I like to use the open source [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) framework. We'll talk more about why in the [Good serverless dev experience](/serverless-dx) chapter.

With the serverless framework we're going to configure servers using YAML files. You write config, framework figures out the rest.

Install it globally:

```sh
npm install -g serverless
```

You'll need AWS credentials too.

I recommend following [Serverless's guide on AWS setup](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/). It walks you through the necessary steps on your Amazon account and a couple terminal commands to run.

### Create a tiny project

There are no special initializers for serverless projects. You start with a directory and add a configuration file.

![](../../images/start-serverless.gif)

```sh
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
touch serverless.yml
touch handler.js
```

You now have a project with 2 files:

- `serverless.yml` for configuration
- `handler.js` for server code

In future chapters you'll write backends using TypeScript. But one thing at a time :)

### Configure your first server

Configuration for your server goes in `serverless.yml`. We're telling the Serverless framework that we want to use AWS, run nodejs, and that this is a dev project.

Then we'll tell it where to find the code.

```yaml
# serverless.yml

service: hello-world

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  stage: dev
```

Our service is called `hello-world` and there's a couple details about our provider. The `stage` tells the difference between development, QA, and production deployments. More on that in the [Dev, QA, and prod](/dev-qa-prod) chapter.

#### Let's tell our server how to run code.

```yaml
# serverless.yml

service: hello-world

provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: nodejs12.x
    stage: dev

functions:
    hello:
        handler: ./handler.hello
        events:
            - http:
	              path: hello
	              method: GET
	              cors: true
```

We started a `functions` section.

Each entry becomes its own tiny server ‚Äì¬†a serverless lambda. Together, they're the `hello-world` service.

The `hello` lambda calls an exported `hello` function inside our `handler.js` file when a GET request hits `/hello`.

All that from these few lines of code üëå

_PS: enabling [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) lets you call this function from other websites. Like your frontend app._

### Write your first backend function

Backend functions in a serverless environment look like the JavaScript functions you're used to. Grab arguments, return a response.

Add a hello function to `handler.js`

```javascript
// handler.js

exports.hello = async (event) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "Hello üëã",
  }
}
```

It's an async function that accepts a trigger event and returns a response. A success status with a `Hello üëã` body.

That's it. You wrote backend code. ü§ò

### Deploy your first serverless backend

To deploy, we run `serverless deploy`.

![](../../images/deploy-serverless.gif)

And your server is up.

You get a URL for your lambda and some debugging output. My URL is `https://z7pc0lqnw9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`, if you open it in your browser, it's going to say `Hello üëã`

I'll keep it up because it's free unless somebody clicks. And when they do, current AWS pricing gives me 1,000,000 clicks per month for free üòõ

### What you got

The Serverless framework talked to AWS and configured many things.

![](../../images/hello-world-lambda.png)

- **API Gateway** to proxy requests from the internet to your function
- **Lambda** to run your code. This is a tiny container that wakes up when called.
- **CloudWatch logs** to collect logs from your code. Helps with debugging.

All those are configured for you. No UI to click through, no config to forget about next time, nothing your friends have to set up to deploy the same code.

Exciting!
