Hello ðŸ‘‹

You came here from the back cover of Serverless Handbook, or one of the prompts offering interactive features. I hope that means you're enjoying the book :)

As promised, the live digital edition is included with your purchase.

Same content as the Kindle or Paperback, except the gifs move, the emojis all work, the code is copypasta, and links are clickable. I know there's some real big links in the book ðŸ˜…

My favorite interactive feature right now are the cloud function test widgets embedded in some chapters. Quick way to test what you're building.

## Here's how it works

1. Share a photo of your book on [twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Learning%20about%20%23serverless%20from%20@swizec's%20new%20Serverless%20Handbook%20and%20...%20https%3A%2F%2Fserverlesshandbook.dev), [facebook](https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fserverlesshandbook.dev), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fserverlesshandbook.dev), or your favorite place to share things
