Hello! üëã

Are you a frontend engineer diving into backend? Do you have just that one bit of code that can't run in the browser? Something that deals with secrets and APIs?

<Box sx={{ width: ["100%", "100%", "70%"], margin: "0 auto", mb: 3 }}>
  <Box
    sx={{
      width: "100%",
      height: 0,
      paddingBottom: 900 / 16 + "%",
      position: "relative",
      overflow: "hidden",
      "& > iframe": {
        position: "absolute",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        top: 0,
        bottom: 0,
        left: 0,
        border: 0,
      },
    }}

That's what cloud functions are for my friend. You take a JavaScript function, run it on serverless, get a URL, and voila.

But that's easy mode. Any tutorial can teach you that.

**What happens when you wanna build a real backend?** When you want to understand what's going on? Have opinions on REST vs GraphQL, NoSQL vs. SQL, databases, queues, talk about performance, cost, data processing, deployment strategies, developer experience?

## Dive into modern backend. Understand any backend

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.1em" }}>
  <strong>Serverless Handbook</strong> shows you how with{" "}
  <strong>360 pages</strong> for people like you getting into backend
  programming.
</p>

With **digital + paperback content** Serverless Handbook has been more than 1 year in development. Lessons learned from 14 years of building production grade websites and webapps.

> With Serverless Handbook, Swiz teaches the truths of distributed systems ‚Äì things will fail ‚Äì but he also gives you insight on how to architect projects using reliability and resilience perspectives so you can monitor and recover.

> ~ Thai Wood, author of Resilience Roundup

If you want to understand backends, grok serverless, or just get a feel for modern backend development, this is the book for you.

Serverless Handbook full of **color illustrations**, **code you can try**, and **insights you can learn**. But it's not a cookbook and it's not a tutorial.

[![Serverless Handbook on your bookshelf](../images/serverless-handbook-bookshelf.jpg)](https://geni.us/serverless-handbook)

Yes, there's a couple tutorials to get you started, to show you how it fits together, but the focus is on high-level concepts.

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.1em" }}>
  <strong>Ideas</strong>, <strong>tactics</strong>, and{" "}
  <strong>mindsets</strong> that you need. Because every project is different.
</p>

The Serverless Handbook takes you _from your very first cloud function to modern backend mastery_. In the words of an early reader:

> Serverless Handbook taught me high-leveled topics. I don't like recipe courses and these chapters helped me to feel like I'm not a total noob anymore.

> The hand-drawn diagrams and high-leveled descriptions gave me the feeling that I don't have any critical "knowledge gaps" anymore.

> ~ Marek C, engineer

If you can JavaScript, you can backend.

Plus it looks great on your bookshelf üòâ

> This handbook is a fantastic overview of what it means to embrace serverless technology. After explaining what the heck "serverless" really means, the book digs deep into the core elements of serverless in an easy-to-follow illustrative manner with ready deployable code!

> After learning about all the primitives (functions/queues/s3/etc.) you'd need as a serverless dev, the book also covers other critical operational aspects like observability, multi-staged deployments & handling secrets.

> It's a great book on using infrastructure-as-code tools like the serverless framework to achieve more with less.

> I'm highly impressed by Swizecs's approach to teaching devs how to adopt new serverless technology.

> ~ David Wells, Serverless Framework core contributor
