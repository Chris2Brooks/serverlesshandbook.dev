# Handling Secrets

![](../images/chapter_headers/handling-secrets.svg)

Imagine you want to send an SMS when users click a button.

You find a JavaScript library that talks to an SMS provider. Configure your API keys, call the library, users get an SMS. Yay!

3 months later you wake up to a $5,000 bill from your SMS provider. Someone looked at your JavaScript code, took the API keys, and ran a spam campaign.

![](giphy:oops)

Securely talking to 3rd party APIs is where Serverless shines. Cloud functions are the perfect environment for glue code.

You get a piece of code that runs on-demand and consumes no resources when not in use. You get isolated functionality that does *one* thing with no cruft. 

**And it all runs on a server where users can't see the code.** There's no right-click inspect, no JavaScript files downloaded, no user environment at all.

## What is a secret

A secret is any piece of information you shouldn't share.

These are passwords and secret API tokens. Keys that give access to a special resource.

You can expand secrets to include configuration variables. URLs for parts of your system, ports of a database server, semi-hardcoded data, etc.

How secretive you have to be depends on context.

Configuration variables are okay to leak, if the system is otherwise secure. But they might give an attacker information about your system. Like the location of your database.

Production passwords for sensitive health information ... you don't even want your engineers to know those. Especially not former engineers.

## 3 ways to handle secrets

Depending on your level of secrecy, there's 3 ways to handle secrets. From least to most secure.

1. Hardcode values
2. Dotenv files
3. Secrets manager

Each method comes with different pros and cons. Pros in terms of security, cons in how cumbersome to use.

## Hardcoded values in code

```typescript
MY_SECRET_KEY="f3q20-98facv87432q4"
```

Hardcoded secrets are the easiest to use and the least secure.

They're okay for quick development and testing an integration. Reduces moving pieces and ensures you're focusing on the API integration not the meta work around your goal.

Your code runs on the server, which means users won't be able to steal your secrets.

But the method is insecure. Anyone with access to your code can see your secrets. 

That includes the whole world, if you share as open source on GitHub. Bots are scraping GitHub looking for strings that look like keys. Your secret *will* be stolen.

Providers like AWS are paranoid enough that they have their own bots looking for secret keys. If they find yours, they lock your AWS account. [Ask me how I know](https://swizec.com/blog/what-happens-when-you-push-aws-credentials-to-github/) üòÖ

Another issue with hardcoded keys is that they're hard to change. You have to re-deploy every time. And you can't use a different account for testing and production.

## Dotenv files

A step-up from hardcoded keys are dotenv files ‚Äì¬†`.env`. Configuration files in your repository that keep your secrets.

```bash
# .env
MY_SECRET_KEY=f3q20-98facv87432q4
MY_API_URL=https://example.com
```

A `.env` file collects all your secrets and configuration variables in one place. Makes them easier to use and change without going through your code.

**You should *not* commit these values as part of your codebase.** That's where the increased security comes from. 

The usual approach is to:

1. Have an empty file listing all variables committed to your code
2. Every engineer makes a copy
3. Fills it with values from team members or a shared passwords manager

Means you'll never leak secrets to GitHub by accident. But they're unencrypted on everyone's laptop, difficult to change across a large team, and packaged into your deploys.

Anyone who breaks into a laptop or steals your deploy package from S3 can read the secrets.

On the bright side, they're easy to split between environments. You can have `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.development` with different values for each secret. ‚úåÔ∏è

### How to use .env files

Many frameworks have native support for `.env` files. Populate the file and values show up in `process.env` on deploy.

When using the Serverless Framework, you'll need a plugin: `serverless-dotenv-plugin`. Here's what you do.

Install the plugin

```
yarn add serverless-dotenv-plugin
```

Enable it in your serverless.yml config:

```yaml
# serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin
```

Run deploy and access values with `process.env` ü§ò

You can match environment specific files to deployments using the `stage: X` config. serverless-dotenv-plugin uses the `.env.X` file that matches your stage.

## Secrets manager

The most secure way to handle secrets is using a secrets manager. This is the preferred approach.

A secrets manager works like the password manager in your browser. You have to authenticate to get access, you have to re-authenticate *every time*, and your secrets are encrypted when not in use.

And your secrets are double blind. *Nobody* knows their values.

Your engineers can't see secrets in the code, they're not saved on anyone's laptop, you can't steal them from the server itself, and with the right configuration, secrets change every N days automatically.

### How to use a secrets manager

If you're on Netlify or Vercel, their secrets system is a secrets manager. They control the run-time and inject those values straight into your `process.env`.

On AWS, you'll have to partially build your own.

**First**, save your secrets in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home). Follow the wizard, it's great.

![AWS Secrets Manager configuration](../images/secrets-manager.png)

You can store infinite secret values in a single configuration. I recommend grouping them by environment ‚Äì¬†dev, staging, production, etc ‚Äì¬†or using a logical grouping based on use. One secret per API you're accessing.

**Second**, give your code permission to access the secrets.

```yaml
# serverless.yml
provider:
  # ...
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: "Allow"
      Action:
        - "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
      Resource: "arn:aws:secretsmanager:${self:provider.region}:*"
```

Notice, you're giving permission to `GetSecretValue`, not to make changes. This is important. You do not want someone hacking into your system and locking you out.

Using an asterisk ‚Äì¬†`*` ‚Äì¬†for secret name is convenient. For more security limit access to specific secrets.

**Third**, access your secrets at runtime.

```typescript
import { SecretsManager } from "aws-sdk"

const ssm = new SecretsManager({
  region: "us-east-1", // make sure this matches your region
})

const secret = await ssm
  .getSecretValue({ SecretId: "<your secret name>" })
  .promise()

const { MY_SECRET_KEY, MY_API_URL } = JSON.parse(secret?.SecretString)
```

Instantiates a new SSM client, gets your secret value, returns a JSON. Parse that JSON, get the secrets.

Note that this is [an API call that might fail](https://serverlesshandbook.dev/robust-backend-design). Make sure to handle errors and fail correctly, if you can't get the secret.

You'll have to do this every time.

Fetching a fresh secret every time ensures you get the right value. You never know when the value in Secrets Manager might change for any reason.

Plus even if an attacker gets access to your server, the secret lives unencrypted in memory for a short time. Making it harder to steal.

Fetching secrets every time introduces latency, however. Consider a memoization strategy that stores secrets in memory for a few minutes.

They'll never live longer than your cloud function :)

## Conclusion

Choose the strategy that fits your use-case and safety requirements.

I like to hardcode development values in the tinkering phase and *change keys afterwards*. You never know what you leaked.

When my code's ready, I put configuration values in `.env` files and secrets in Secrets Manager.
