Hey thanks again for supporting Serverless Handbook. I hope it helps you on your journey.

Here's what happens next üëá

I just saved a cookie in your browser. Now it knows that you have full access to the content. No more opt-in buttons, hidden content, or anything like that. Get started with the menu on the left, or click the Back button to see the page you were looking at before.

My robots created an account for you and sent an email with further instructions. **You'll have to set a password.**

Over the next few weeks, you'll get a chapter in your inbox every 3 days or so. Because buying books and reading books are different hobbies :)
