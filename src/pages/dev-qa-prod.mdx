# Dev, QA, and prod

![Dev, QA, and prod](../images/chapter_headers/dev-qa-prod.svg)

You're building an app and want to show off to a friend. Do you ship to production?

You're trying a new feature that doesn't do localhost. Do you publish?

You've built a pipeline that edits user data and want to make sure it works. Test in production?

If you're brave enough ... 

## Before there's users

None of this matters until you have users. Build on the main branch, ship to production, test in real life. Enjoy yourself!

Coding at this stage is *fun*. 

You don't have to worry about corrupting user data. No concerns about disrupting a user's workflow. You don't even need to worry about shipping bugs!

If nobody noticed the bug, was the bug even there?

A word of caution: It's easy to fill your database full of crappy data. Try to start production clean. 

Thank me later when counting users is easy instead of a 5 step process. You'd be surprised how hard it can become to answer *"How many users do we have?"*.

## Localhost vs. Production

Once you have users, you need a way to distinguish production from development. That's easy on a solo project.

Localhost is for development, production is for production. Run a copy of production on your machine and test.

As your system grows this gets trickier and trickier. You need to host a database, run queues, caching layers, etc.

You can get close with the [LocalStack plugin for the Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-localstack). But only production is like production. ✌️

Besides, you can't show off localhost to a friend or coworker.

## The 3 stage split

A common solution to the production vs. development problem is the 3 stage split:

0. localhost
1. development
2. staging / QA
3. production

You build and test on localhost. Get fast iteration and reasonable certainty that your code works.

You then push to development. A deployed environment that's like production, but frothy. Changes frequently, data is irrelevant, used by many developers.

The development environment helps you test your code with others' work. You can show off to a friend, coworker, or product manager to get early feedback.

When that works, you push to staging. A more stable environment used to test code right before it ships. Features are production ready, early feedback incorporated.

Staging is the playground for your QA team and final sign-off from product managers.

Then you push to production. 🚀

### How to use the 3 stage split

Infrastructure-as-code makes the 3 stage split easy to set up. Have 3 branches of your codebase, deploy each to its own stage.

With the serverless framework, you configure the deploy stage in `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
# serverless.yml
service: my-service

provider:
	name: aws
	stage: dev
```

Deploy with `sls deploy` and you create the `dev` stage. 

With the serverless framework, stages work via namespacing. Every resource uses the stage as part of its name and URL.

Make sure you keep that in mind when naming resources manually. When naming a queue for example:

```yaml
# serverless.yml
resources:
  Resources:
    TimesTwoQueue:
      Type: "AWS::SQS::Queue"
      Properties:
        # include the stage variable in your name
        QueueName: "TimesTwoQueue-${self:provider.stage}"
```

### Dynamic stages

Editing the stage in `serverless.yml` every time you deploy is annoying. You can pass it in the command line instead.

```yaml
# serverless.yml

provider:
	name: aws
	# use stage option, dev by default
	stage: ${opt:stage, "dev"}
```

Deploy with `sls deploy --stage prod` to deploy to production. Defaults to `dev`.

Use a new stage to set up a new environment, or an existing stage to update. The framework figures it out for you.

Make sure stage names match any [`.env.X` configuration files](/handling-secrets).

## Deploy previews

The 3 stage split starts breaking down around the 6 to 7 engineers mark. More if your projects are small, less if they're big.

You start stepping on each other's toes.

Alice is working on a big feature, she'll need 3 months. During that time none of her work can go to production. She'd like to test on development.

Bob meanwhile is fixing bugs and keeping the lights on. He needs to merge his work into development, staging, and production daily.

How can Bob and Alice both work together?

There are 2 answers:

1. Deploy previews
2. Feature flags

With infrastructure-as-code, deploy previews are the simple solution. Create a new stage for every large feature, deploy, show off, and test.

You get an isolated environment with all the working bits and pieces. Automate it with GitHub Actions to create a new stage for every pull request.

That's the model Netlify and Vercel support. Every pull request gets automatically deployed on a new copy of production with every update. 👌

## Trunk-based development

A popular approach in large teams is trunk-based development.

Everyone works on the main branch, deploys to production regularly, and uses feature flags to disable features that aren't ready. A strong automated testing culture with good coverage is critical.

Google uses the Beyonce rule:

> If you liked it, you shoulda put a test on it

Anyone can change any code at any time. Tests help prevent accidents.

Feature flags let you disable new features until they're ready. Your code hits production quickly thus ensuring it doesn't break anything. If you refactored something, others can use it. If you created new background functionality, it's available.

But you disable user-facing parts to avoid a broken user experience.

Implementing feature flags can be as easy as an environment variable with a bunch of IF statements, or as complex as progressive canary deploys. Those let you reveal a feature to 1% of users, then 5%, then 10, etc.

## Which approach should you pick?

Depends on team size, established norms, correctness requirements, and your deployment environment.

If you have a clean infrastructure-as-code approach, creating new stages at will is great. If you need manual setup, the 3 stage approach is best.

You can even split your project into sub-projects. Isolated areas of concern that can move and deploy independently. Microservices.

And remember, the easier your code is to fix and deploy, the less you have to worry about any of this.

For side projects I like to test in production. Live wild 🤘
