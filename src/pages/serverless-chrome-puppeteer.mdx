Say you want to build a scraper, automate some manual testing, or generate custom social cards for your website. What do you do?

One thing you could do is to spin up a docker container, set up headless Chrome, add Puppeteer, write a script to run it all, add a server to create an API, and host it all somewhere.

Or you can set up Serverless Chrome with AWS Lambda. Write a bit of code, hit deploy, get a full Chrome browser running on demand.

That's what this chapter is about ðŸ¤˜

In the next few minutes you'll learn how to:

- configure Chrome Puppeteer on AWS
- build a basic scraper
- take website screenshots
- run it on-demand, for free (as per AWS pricing)

As usual, we're using the serverless framework and typescript. You can see the [full example code on GitHub]()
