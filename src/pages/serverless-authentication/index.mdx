# Serverless authentication

![](../../images/chapter_headers/dealing-with-authentication.svg)

In theory, authentication is easy: Save an identifier on the client, send with every request, check against a stored value on the server.

In practice, authentication is hard.

Where do you save the identifier? How does the client get it? What authentication scheme do you use? What do you save on the server? How do you keep it secure? What do you send with each request? How do you run authenticated code without the client?

Authentication is a deep rabbit hole. In this chapter we look at the must knows and implement 2 common approaches.
