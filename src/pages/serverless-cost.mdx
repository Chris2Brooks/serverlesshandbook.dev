# Serverless cost optimization

![](../images/chapter_headers/serverless-cost-optimization.svg)

Metered pricing is one of serverless's big innovations. Pay what you use and nothing more.

To optimize cost, you need to:

1. [Improve performance](/serverless-performance)
2. Optimize flow

Requests stuck in the system, queues bulging with data, retrying mistakes, all that costs money. More than you'd think.

## What is flow

describe flow, use the typical anecdote from those books

## Theory of constraints

theory of constraints and how to think about managing your stuff

WIP is the productivity killer

flow through the whole system is what matters

mention amdahl's law

## Queuing theory

describe queuing theory in its basics

mention little's law and why it's important
