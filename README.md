# Serverless Handbook for frontend engineers

Curious about serverless? Wanna get into backend but not sure how? This handbook is for you. 

Rather than a book you read start to finish, it's meant to work as a reference. A handbook that stands by your side while you work. Need a recipe? Look it up. Got a question on a thorny issue? The handbook hopes to help.

Open source, contributions and fixes welcome :)
